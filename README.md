# AStar_PathFinding

## Visualisation of A* pathfinding algorithm
## Rules
-start/end node must be placed in order to start algorithm
-after the algorithm finish working you can only reset the grid by pressing R

### Controlls

- SPACE-start algorithm
- R-reset
- B-set start
- E-set end
- P-set random walls

- Scroll Up/Down - change randomness ratio
- left mouse click - place wall
- right mouse click - delete wall
-left mouse drag - draw wall line
- left + right mouse drag - draw thicker wall line
